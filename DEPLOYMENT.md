# Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the School Management System to various hosting platforms.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Environment Variables**
   Create these environment variables in your hosting platform:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=your_db_host
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_NAME=school_management
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_app_url
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   - Run the SQL script in `scripts/init-db.sql`
   - Or let the app auto-create the table on first run

## üîß Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database created and accessible
- [ ] Image upload directory permissions set
- [ ] Build process tested locally
- [ ] All dependencies included in package.json
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Responsive design verified

## üö® Important Notes

1. **File Uploads**
   - Static hosting (Vercel, Netlify) may not persist uploaded files
   - Consider using cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary) for production

2. **Database Connections**
   - Ensure your database allows connections from your hosting platform
   - Configure connection pooling for better performance

3. **CORS**
   - May need to configure CORS settings for cross-origin requests

## üîç Testing Deployment

1. **Functionality Test**
   - Add a new school
   - Verify it appears in the list
   - Test image upload
   - Check responsive design

2. **Performance Test**
   - Test loading times
   - Verify image optimization
   - Check mobile performance

## üêõ Common Deployment Issues

### Database Connection Failed
- Verify connection string
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure database is accessible from hosting platform

### Image Upload Not Working
- Check file permissions
- Verify upload directory exists
- Consider cloud storage for production

### Build Errors
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Test build locally first

## üìä Monitoring

Consider adding monitoring tools:
- **Vercel Analytics** (if using Vercel)
- **Google Analytics**
- **Sentry** for error tracking
- **Uptime monitoring** services

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

Example GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues during deployment:
1. Check the hosting platform's documentation
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check application logs for errors
4. Test the application locally first
